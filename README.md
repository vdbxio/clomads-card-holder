# Concrete Business Card Holder

## Description

A  business card holder designed by Chloe Madison (@clomads) from a 3D model that was then 3D printed, molded, cast in concrete. Additionally it features a steel ball and magnet to keep cards in place. It is available for purchase from Chloe Madison's Etsy shop (clomads.etsy.com) or from Voidbox Industries via Amazon prime. You can make your own with the details in these docs.

## Fusion 360 Parametric 3D Model

[http://a360.co/2G56mrX](http://a360.co/2G56mrX)

The Fusion 360 file is the original source design from Chloe Madison. Parametric design allows you to see how it was made and make prefered changes along the way. If you just want to 3D print the model, read the next section.

## STL Mesh for 3D Printing

(Thingiverse URL???)

Download this file if you just want to download and make the thing as it was designed. This requires a 3D printer and knowledge of slicing programs.

You're more than welcome to stop at a 3D printed version. We have a couple ourselves, but if you want to know more about how to make it out of concrete, read on.

## Choosing filament and sanding prints

Before making your 3D model you should consider that you'll likely have to sand it for the molding process. In our experience this means printing in ABS. Choose a good layer height for your printer... as fine as possible is reccomended. 

While sanding the 3D print is highly reccomended, it may not be necessary if you're making only one or two. Your goal is to make the mold as smooth as possible so sand the print and then fill any gaps with super glues and sand some more. You'll likely also end up sanding the final concrete part too, so it's up to you where you want to spend your time.

## Molding process

We use Mold-Star 30 Platium Silicone mold from Smooth-On for our molds, but everyone has their preferences. Make sure you have a container that can hold the liquid around your 3D print while it cures. Mix Part A & Part B thouroughly and pour carefully over your part. Make sure to reference the documents of your mold material to make sure you're doing the thing right. When the mold is cured (usually no longer that 24 hours) take your container apart and carefully remove the 3D print from the mold. You may have to use a hobby knife to clean up some areas. 

I highly suggest googling or youtubeing mold making to help with your process on this step.


## Pouring Concrete

Choosing your cement mix appropriately is important if you want to obtain a specific look. We've played around with various mixes and have landed on a not-scientifically-measured mix of Portland Cement, Glass Fiber Fill, and cement plasticiser. This mix gives us a smooth finish after sanding and the fiber fill creates strength and can many times be seen in the final finish as a 'whispy' design within the concrete. The Plasticiser reduces water consumption by the concrete, also increasing strength. An interesting occurance of this mix is sometimes the appearance of spiderweb like micro-fractures across the entire surface of the object. This doesn't appear to be a detriment to the strength of the object as a whole. 

Additional options for concrete mix include adding sand or stone aggregates. These items will give the final product a much more rough surface that can still be sanded, but will kill all your sandpaper and have sex with its mother.

In all honesty though, you will reduce your ability to efficiently use sandpaper on concrete items with sand in their mix and will likely have to move to some sort of grinding wheel if using stone... you will literally be cutting through rock. 

Let us know what your favorite concrete mix is!

## Finishing Concrete

This section assumes you've used our mix above of Cement, Glass Fiber, and Plasticiser. We've found that wet sanding with mechanical means to be the best. Start low to get rid of high spots (80 grit), this can be done without water and we usually use a handheld random-orbit sander. A medium pass at around 200-300 can be a good middle ground, followed by a pass at 400-600 or higher. If using more powerful equipment you can sometime skip straight to the 400 (eg. Benchtop belt sander). For the detailed inside parts (inner corners, ball holder, magnet), we use a Dremel rotary tool with EZ-Lock sanding pads at 240 grit with a hand sanding at 400-600 to remove excess debris and smooth to final finish.
